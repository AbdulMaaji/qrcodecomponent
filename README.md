## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Through this project i've learned about the div HTML element, and it makes the work easy.


```html
<div>
  <p>Some HTML code I'm proud of</p>
</div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable styling a table, and i plan to focus on it.

### Useful resources
